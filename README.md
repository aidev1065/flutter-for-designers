# Flutter for Designers
![](https://cl.ly/6338dcbc2dd6/download/1.jpg)
---
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is a popular mobile app developing framework built by Google to quickly and easily develop apps across platforms. It uses native components to create a real mobile app indistinguishable from one made using Xcode or Android Studio. With Flutter, you'll get access to technologies like hot reload and other web developing tools that have become popular over the past few years. Most importantly, you're building for both iOS and Android using the same codebase.

## Install Flutter

Before starting, you'll need the Flutter and Dart SDK to create cross platform apps. To install Flutter, head over to [Flutter's installation page](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) where you can follow the instructions and download the SDK relative to your system.

## Install Xcode

If you're on a Mac, I highly recommend [installing Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) for the required **Command Line Tools** and for using the iOS Simulator.

## Install Android Studio

For this course, I recommend [installing Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/studio) as we will be using it as our IDE. This is because Android Studio provides quick and easy shortcuts that can enhance your workflow when developing for Flutter. Since we are building for both iOS and Android, it will be helpful to test our app on both the iOS Simulator and the Android Virtual Device emulator.
